I didn't start university studying computer science. But two years into my studies I found I was reading computer science textbooks for fun. I was teaching myself to program Haskell with a text book and pen and paper over the summer in a flat with no internet and no computer. It was painfully obvious to me that I was doing the wrong degree and eventually I sucked up the courage to switch and I haven't looked back. 

Having studied as an undergraduate computer-scientist at Bristol University for the past three years I have become utterly absorbed with Cryptography and Security. I find the blend of mathematics with psychology; code and disassembly; attack and defence utterly absorbing. Now I am finishing my undergraduate studies I want to spend my time not just studying it but contributing to it as well. I believe the best way to start doing this is to begin working for a PhD. 

For the past three years I have worked as a teaching assistant for the *Procedural Programming* and *Principles of Programming* units here at Bristol University helping the first year students take their first steps into programming. It has been extremely rewarding work and I enjoy the responsibility and the pressures of helping get the students past their coursework. 
For the last two years I have also helped run the Shorinji Kempo society at Bristol's student union, as the secretary, web-master and vice-president. I created the society's website, some of their marketing materials and have helped organize a national seminar for the club in Bristol. 

Before transferring to computer science I spent a year in industry working for *GE Oil & Gas* working on developing their test software. Prior to that I spent a summer working for the metrology firm *Renishaw* in their research and development department. Working in industry gave me a great experience of the software engineering industry, but it also convinced me that a career in research, working at the cutting edge in computer science, is what I want to do.  Bristol has a strong tradition of meshing together both the theory and engineering practice of leading cryptographic research which I want to become part of.

I have spent the last six years living and working in Bristol I am keen to stay in the South-Westâ€”I have a house and my partner lives here. Bristol University has a fantastic Cryptography department which I want to join it to continue my studies.
