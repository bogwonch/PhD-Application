<h2 id="why-cryptography-programming">Why Cryptography &amp; Programming</h2>
<p>I didn’t start university studying computer science. But two years into my studies I found I was reading computer science textbooks for fun. I was teaching myself to program <em>Haskell</em> with a text book and pen and paper over the summer in a flat with no internet and no computer. It was painfully obvious to me that I was doing the wrong degree and eventually I sucked up the courage to switch and I haven’t looked back.</p>
<p>Having studied as an undergraduate computer scientist at Bristol University for the past three years I have studied algorithms, architecture, cryptography and security and I am utterly fascinated by each of them but especially the cryptography and security. I find the blend of mathematics with psycology; code with disassembly absorbing. Now I am finishing my undergraduate studies I want to spend my time not just studying it but contributing to it as well. I believe the best way to start doing this is to begin studying for a PhD.</p>
<h2 id="why-bristol">Why Bristol</h2>
<p>Having spent the last six years living and working in Bristol I am keen to stay in the South-West—I have a house and my partner lives here. Bristol University has a fantastic Cryptography department and I would like to join it to continue my studies.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>For the past three years I have worked as a teaching assistant for the <em>Procedural Programming</em> and <em>Principles of Programming</em> units here at Bristol University helping the first year students take their first steps into programming. It has been extremely rewarding work and I enjoy the responsibility and the pressures of helping get the students past their courseworks.</p>
<p>Before transferring to computer science I spent a year in industry working for <em>GE Oil &amp; Gas</em> working on developing their test software. Prior to that I spent a summer working for the metrology firm <em>Renishaw</em> in their research and development department. Working in industry gave me a great experience of the software engineering industry, but it also convinced me that a career in research is much better suited to me than a career as an engineer.</p>
<p>For the last two years I have also helped run the Shorinji Kempo society at Bristol’s student union, as the secretary, webmaster and vice-president. I created the society’s website, some of their marketting materials and have helped organize a national seminar for the club in Bristol.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>I am a competent programmer, fluent in C and Haskell and familiar with half a dozen other programming languages including Java, various assembly languages, Python and R. I expect to graduate from Bristol University with a MEng in Computer Science, specialising in Cryptography and Security.</p>
